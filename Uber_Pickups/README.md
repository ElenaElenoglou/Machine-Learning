## Company's Description 📇

[Uber](http://uber.com/) is one of the most famous startup in the world. It started as a ride-sharing application for people who couldn't afford a taxi. Now, Uber expanded its activities to Food Delivery with [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/fr-en), package delivery, freight transportation and even urban transportation with [Jump Bike](https://www.uber.com/fr/en/ride/uber-bike/) and [Lime ](https://www.li.me/)that the company funded.

The company's goal is to revolutionize transportation across the globe. It operates now on about 70 countries and 900 cities and generates over $14 billion revenue! 😮



## Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.

Even though both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.

Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where **their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.**

## Scope of this project 🖼️
For this project, we'll work with a dataset that contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price, that might be useful for predicting the amount of sales. 🤓



## Resources Used 📖

- Packages: **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, sklearn**
- Dataset by Jedha.



## Deliverable 📬

* A map with hot-zones per day of week using DBScan.
